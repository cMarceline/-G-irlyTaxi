For Marcie Todo

Pre Production:
- [ ] Create a working prototype of the cart controller
- [ ] Rough WIP art pass for cart
- [ ] Have a meeting planned at some point to sort out the direction of the project
- [ ] Fill out the moodboard a bit more, cull images that don't fit style
- [ ] Decide on audio setup (middleware or not?) and style (what do we want the music to be like, what sounds do we want etc etc.)
- [ ] Decide on what platform/specs we're aiming for
