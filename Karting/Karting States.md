> [!IMPORTANT]- Four State System
> Four states of karting as follows
# Driving
Standard [[F-Zero]]/[[Wipeout]] style gameplay where you are bound to whatever surface you are on
# Flying
When **using [[Boost Gauge|Boosters]]** when in air you will enter a fly state
You will burn through your [[Boost Gauge]] FAST while flying
# Falling
When not in [[#Driving]] or [[#Flying]] state you will simply fall
**Gravity is relative to the bottom of your cart**, allowing you to orient your fall onto another track
When Falling your **timer will drain faster** and if falling for too long, you will lose your passengers
# Floating
You are allowed to **"detach" from the course** at any time by entering a float
You will **maintain whatever momentum** you went into the float with
you can **freely rotate** your cart to anticipate your [[#Flying|Fly]] or [[#Falling|Fall]]
Always lasts like **1 second** *(TBD)*
